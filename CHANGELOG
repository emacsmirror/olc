	Fix issue #7:
	* olc.texi: Fix documentation of olc-recover-compound, which was
	plain wrong. Add documentation and examples for the "format"
	keyword arg to olc-deocde. Update examples in olc-recover and
	olc-recover-compound. Consistently format nil as code.

	* olc.el (olc-recover): Change from cons to list in latlon return
	value. Will still only bump minor versions since there are no
	users other than me.
	(olc-is-valid): More flexible match for the separator after the
	code.
	(olc-decode): Added the "format" keyword arg.

	Fix issue #6:
	* olc.texi (Functions): Document "compound". Correct error in
	documentation of return value for olc-is-full and olc-is-short.

	* olc.el (olc-parse-code): Document that match data is changed.
	(olc-is-valid): Added the "compound" keyword arg.
	(olc-is-full): Added the "compound" keyword arg.
	(olc-is-short): Added the "compound" keyword arg.

	Fix issue #4:
	* olc.el (olc-shorten-compound): Better handling of empty response
	from nominatim.
	(olc-recover-compound): Detect empty response from nominatim.
	(olc-position-of): New function.
	(olc-encode): Use cl-check-type to detect invalid encoding
	lengths.
	(general): Make errors more consistent.
	(olc-shorten): Correctly signal shortcode and padded errors.
	(olc-shorten-compound): Correctly signal shortcode and padded
	errors.
	(olc-parse-code): Match padding only at pos so parsing continues
	if there are zeros later on in the code. The correct codes were
	considred invalid, but we got the wrong errors.

	* olc.texi (Errors): Document all the errors.

	* test/olctest.el: Improved error-checking assertion. Added
	support for expected failures.

	Fix issue #2:
	* olc.el (olc-parse-code): Add type checks.
	(olc-encode): Add type checks.
	(olc-shorten): Add type checks.
	(olc-shorten-compound): Add type and range checks.
	(olc-recover): Add type checks.

	Fix issue #3:
	* olc.el (olc-parse-code): Save match data.
	(olc-is-valid): Save match data.
	(olc-shorten-compound): Save match data.
	(olc-recover-compound): Save match data.
	(olc-is-valid): Rewrote as string operations.
	(olc-value-mapping): Changed to defconst.
	(olc-digit-mapping): Changed to defconst.
	(olc-is-short): Operate on string.
	(olc-is-full): Operate on string.

	Fix issue #1 more properly:
	* olc.el (olc-recover): Honor format arg when dealing with full
	codes.
	(olc-recover-compound): Defer to olc-recover when dealing with
	full codes.

	Fix issue #1 (olc-recover-compound fails on full codes):
	* test/olctest.el: Improved test macros. Tests for issue 1.

	* olc.el (general): Whitespace fixes.
	(olc-recover-error): New error.
	(olc-recover-compound): New argument list. Type checks. Handle
	full codes being passed.

	Fix test cases:
	* test/olctest.el: Use keyword args in test cases. Replace
	interactive-only functions with better ones. Implement testing for
	batch mode.

	Clean up for melpa:
	* olc.el (olc-encode): Use #' instead of ' in apply. Enable
	lexical binding. Rename unused loop variable so it is ignored by
	the byte compiler.
	* olc.el (olc-shorten-compound): Use #' instead of ' in request.
	* olc.el (olc-recover-compound): Use #' instead of ' in request.

	better match Google's terminology in their plus codes api.
	(olc-recover-compound): Same.

	Implement olc-shorten-geo and clean up:
	* olc.el (olc-shorten-geo): New function.
	(olc-encode): Use cl-defun and keyword args.
	(olc-shorten): Use cl-defun and keyword args.
	(olc-recover): Use cl-defun and keyword args.
	(olc-recover-geo): Use cl-defun and keyword args. Renamed from
	olc-recover-string.

	* olc.texi (Functions): Updated to match code changes.

2020-07-21  David Byers  <david.byers@liu.se>

	Clean up
	* olc.el: Declare external functions for the byte compiler. Fix
	whitespace. Shortened lines. Fixed some docstrings. Cleaned up
	comments. Removed DOS line endings. Moved functions around.

	(olc-decode): Converted to use integer math.

	Wrote texinfo documentation:
	* olc.el (olc-parse-length): Removed.
	Updated documentation comment.

	(olc-valid-char): Reimplemented missing function.
	(olc-shorten): New function.
	(olc-recover): Use olc-clip-latitude, not normalize.
